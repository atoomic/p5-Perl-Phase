=head1 NAME

Perl::Phase::AtRunTime - Register code at compile time to run at run time

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Perl::Phase::AtRunTime version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo::Bar;

    use Perl::Phase::AtRunTime sub { say "Hello " __PACKAGE__ . ": ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" };

When Foo::Bar is loaded at compile time it will output C<Hello Foo::Bar: INIT>.

When Foo::Bar is loaded at run time it will output C<Hello Foo::Bar: RUN>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you have a reason to run code when a module is loaded you might reach for C<INIT>.

The problem there is when it is loaded at runtime you get “Too late to run INIT block” warnings and your code does not run.

So then you have to repeat the code w/ an C<if ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} eq 'RUN'> clause.

This module aims to encapsulate all of that madness into a simpler syntax.

=head1 INTERFACE

Pass one or more code references to L<Perl::Phase::AtRunTime>’s C<import()> (i.e. typically a C<use>)
that you want to ensure are executed once at runtime anytime the module is loaded.

Note that C<use warnings;> will be in effect when your code references are run.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Throws no warnings or errors of its own.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND FEATURES

Please report any bugs or feature requests (and a pull request for bonus points)
 through the issue tracker at L<https://github.com/drmuey/p5-Perl-Phase/issues>.
