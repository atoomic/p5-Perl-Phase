=head1 NAME

Perl::Phase - Check if you are currently in compile time or run time

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Perl::Phase version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Perl::Phase;

    sub init_data {
        Perl::Phase::assert_is_run_time(); # so we don’t forever bake the data in if this is perlcc’d

        …
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some code should only run at runtime some only at compile time.

This functions let you check (boolean) or assert (die) either.

=head1 INTERFACE

None of these functions take any arguments.

Any true value returned is also the current phase name.

=head2 Perl::Phase::is_compile_time()

Returns true if executed at compile time, false if executed at run time.

=head2 Perl::Phase::assert_is_compile_time()

Dies if executed at run time, otherwise returns true.

=head2 Perl::Phase::is_run_time()

Returns true if executed at run time, false if executed at compile time.

=head2 Perl::Phase::assert_is_run_time()

Dies if executed at compile time, otherwise returns true.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Assert can have two types of die messages depending on the caller information:

=over

=item C<< %s() called at (run|compile) time at %s line %n >>

=item C<< This code should not be executed at (run|compile) time >>

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=head1 DEPENDENCIES
